## Goal

We will write our own http server as the option 9 in the handout. It should:

* support http 1.0 + 1.1 and pipelining;
* serve multiple types of files from the host machine, including .html, .css, .js, .txt, and .jpg;
* support http 2 over TCP if time allows.

We will implement our project using golang.
